    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This hands-on exercise shows how to use Census API to get data from the Census Bureau and explore demographic changes over time near transit stops. Gentrification is a complex process that involves changes in the character of a neighborhood by means of increased property values or rent and new higher-income residents moving in. The multi-dimensional character of gentrification can be identified in diverse ways (Easton et al., 2020). For example, Freeman (2005) proposed to identify gentrifying neighborhoods by looking at age of housing stock, income, and education level of residents, and change in owner-occupied housing price. Studies usually look at changes in these variables between two time periods (Maciag, 2015; Desmond and Gershenson, 2017). The causes behind gentrification can also be diverse. Gentrification can happen due to transit investment (Dawkins and Moeckel, 2016), urban renewal programs (Mehdipanah et al., 2018), housing policy (Gelb and Lyons, 199), park location (Rigolon and Németh, 2020), tourism (Gotham, 2013), etc.\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This exercise focuses on transit-induced gentrification in Chicago, IL and shows a simple analytical approach to identify gentrifying neighborhoods. Although gentrification is a multi-dimensional phenomenon, in this exercise we will take only one indicator (education attainment) to identify areas which are most likely gentrifying. We will get data on population with bachelor’s degree or higher from the American Community Survey (ACS) of the US Census Bureau, at census tract level for two time periods (2010 and 2019). Changes in the share of population with bachelor’s degree or higher will be our measure of gentrification. We will then take locations of Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) train stations and overlay them on the map showing changes in bachelor’s degree or higher population to identify the areas which are most likely experiencing transit-induced gentrificatio.p\r\n"
